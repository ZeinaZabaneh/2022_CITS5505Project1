            ================================================== --> 
<h1>Code on Demand</h1>
<h2><i>The Recipe to the Web's Success</i></h2>
<section>
    <div class="container pt-5">
    <h2>What is Code on Demand?</h2>
    <p>Susan wants to bake a cake. She has all the ingredients that are required and an oven to complete the task and yet has no idea how to do it. Susan decides to call her friend Tracy who she knows has the right recipe that’s she’s provided to others in the past. This is essentially the same concept for code on demand (COD): The client computer has access to the resources it needs and yet has no knowledge of how to process the resources (Fuggetta et al, 1998). A request is sent to the server computer from the Clients software requesting the know-how. Subsequently, this information (code) is sent back to the Clients computer to execute the code (Carzaniga, Picco & Vigna, 2007).</p>
    <p>Code on demand is a term used to describe any “technology that sends executable software code from a server computer to a client computer upon request from the client's software” (Wikipedia, 2022).  </p>
    <p>In the specific application of COD to the world wide web, the process is initiated when the clients web browser accesses a web page which contains a link to the dormant code. Through the use of hypertext transfer protocol, both the webpage requested and the program are sent to the users’ machine where they are executed locally when the page is displayed (Wikipedia, 2022). The table below shows the functioning concept of Code on Demand in comparison with the other mobile code design paradigms. Where A is computational component located at site S<sub>A</sub> and requires another site (S<sub>B</sub>) to complete a requested service. The location of components before and after execution are indicated and items in bold are the ones which execute the code, those in italics are the ones that move as a result of the service execution.</p>

    <p>Examples of COD on the web include Java applets, Adobe's ActionScript language for the Flash Player, JavaScript and WebAssembly. A brief description of each is provided below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Java applets: small applications launched from a web page but executed in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java applets were deprecated in 2017 following the phasing out of support by major web browsers</li>
        <li>ActionScript: a programming language used for the development of web pages and software for the Adobe Flash Player platform</li>
        <li>WebAssembly: a new programming language which enables high performance applications on web pages</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Advantages</b> <br>COD is the most widely used mobile code paradigm (i.e. design pattern) within the field of code mobility. Its greater success over other design paradigms (Client Server, Remote Evaluation and Mobile Agent) is attributed to two primary factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simplicity -  “the essence of the code on demand paradigm can be supported by an interpreter equipped with a networked dynamic loader”.</li>
            <li>Scalability – rather than placing the computational load on the server, COD requires the client to complete the computation. Given that there are many more clients than servers, this effective load balancing greatly enhances the scalability of this paradigm (Carzaniga, Picco & Vigna, 2007).  </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Additional advantages which assisted in the popularity of COD include offline capability since the code is downloaded and executed on the client computer/device. In situations where a mobile device is disconnected form the network, design paradigms such as mobile agent and remote evaluation are not suitable. This gives COD a clear advantage on being able to effectively manage ‘performance bottleneck, fault-tolerance, availability, service customization, user interface responsiveness, and device mobility’ (Lau et al, 2006).</p>
          <p><i>“In distributed computing, code mobility is the ability for running programs, code or objects to be migrated (or moved) from one machine or application to another. This is the process of moving mobile code across the nodes of a network as opposed to distributed computation where the data is moved”</i> (Wikipedia, 2022).</p>
          <p>Additionally, COD enables the addition of features to the client which in turn increases extensibility, configurability. As the code is executed locally, performance is also enhanced as remote interactions with the server are not required. enhanced performance as the code is adapted to the client environment and is executed locally (Fielding, 2000).</p>
        <p><b>Disadvantages</b><br>
            The biggest concern with the COD paradigm is security, given that code is transmitted from the server rather than data. This presents opportunities in which malicious code is inadvertently run by the Client and attacks their environment. As a result, deployment of code may be affected in instances where the client cannot trust the server (Fielding, 2000).</P>
            <p>Other security concerns include ‘protecting a host from potentially malicious code’ or ‘protecting a mobile code from a potentially malicious host’. In all three instances, special consideration must be given to security features including authentication, verification, sandboxing, code signing etc (Loureiro et al, 2003).</p>

    <h2>The History of Code on Demand</h2>
    <p>In the mid 90’s maintstream technologies such as the Java language environment set out to create an application-deployment environment for dynamic applications. The main designers of Java stated:<br><br>
        <i>The massive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web leads us to a completely new way of looking at development and distribution of software. [. . . ] New code modules can be linked in on demand from a variety of sources, even from sources across a network. [. . . ] Interactive executable code can be loaded from anywhere, which enables transparent updating of applications. The result is on-line services that constantly evolve [and] remain innovative and fresh </i> (Gosling & McGilton, 1996).</p>
        <p>Therefore, at the core of the Java platform was the code on demand paradigm. Not long after, Java was incorporated into web browsers, thereby supporting the strategic direction of progressing the web from simply a collection of static documents to an interactive platform that supported both multi-media and the transmission of applications. Unfortunately however, Java was not to experience the success it was originally predicted to have.</p> 
        <p>JavaScript, a scripting language created to support active and interactive web content, soon took over as the main supporter of COD. Interactive web content was to become the main implementation of the COD paradigm as opposed to rich internet applications (RIA’s). Examples of RIA’s include calendars and spreadsheets by Google which are implemented through JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Zeina and I am a Masters of Data Science student at the University of Western Australia. I was born in the Middle East (Jordan) but moved to Perth with my family when I was 4 years old. I studied Biotechnology and Biomedical Science as my undergrad and worked in HIV and Hepatitis research at an institute which was the collaboration of Murdoch University and Royal Perth Hospital.</p> 
    <p>After a few years, I was ready for a change and completed a Masters of Occupational Health and Safety at Curtin University. At around the same time as commencing my postgraduate studies, I started work in the oil and gas sector with a large global company. My current role requires a lot of data analysis and I felt a natural progression was to upskill yet again and study Data Science, although my family and friends will probably tell you I’m just an eternal student!</p>
        <p>I am married and have a one year old daughter so life can be pretty busy managing full time work, part time uni and family! Our weekends are spent usually in a pool, at a park and having breakfast at one of our favourite cafes. I’m a creative type so my hobbies include drawing and painting. I also love to travel and cant wait to be able to show my daughter all the places I’ve been so fortunate to see.</p>
        </p>
    <!-- Alternate "About Me" -->
        <!-- <p>I am a highly committed and proactive individual with excellent team work, research and planning skills.
